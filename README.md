# Mixing Paradigms on Steroids (with the latest C# specification)

Mixing functional programming and metaprogramming into good-old object-oriented C# is not new. Still, so many programmers don't see it clearly yet: Those paradigms are not additions to an established programming model. They are genuine parts of a unified programming method, support for which is progressively being added to the C# programming language. In this session, we will walk through fundamental elements of programming, object-oriented and functional, and use them to build a powerful and flexible domain model. You will be amused to learn how modern the latest C# language has become, and how it can be applied to design rock-solid object and functional models.
